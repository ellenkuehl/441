# Phew!
## My brain is expanding.

This week was much more complex for me. After hours of trying to disect the information,
understanding the new terms, and praying for my brain to get it, I turned to several resources to help me make my way through.

- Kashya, my friend who went to coding school, was a great resource for me. My mind is very artistic and I have a hard time reading through code while processing everything at the same time. Kashya will draw little charts and diagrams when needed to help me through.
- CodeAcademy. I have heard of this website several times. I'm a little upset with myself that I didn't use this website sooner!! It's definitely a fun way to learn coding.

All in all, this week was a rough one for me. There were times I didn't know where to start or end. I had such little idea that I don't think I could've been too much help on the issues board. 

One thing I do love about coding is knowing all the potential opportunities it has to offer. I really loved seeing my work come together in Web Dev when I could create fun webpages and insert fun elements like hover, or design the page how I want it to be. These few weeks, I have enjoyed learning Javascript, but I can't wait to see it tie together.
