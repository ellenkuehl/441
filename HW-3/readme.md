# Another Great Week!
## Keep on Keepin' on!

This week, I felt a little overwhelmed with the amount of reading we had to do.
Some of the concepts I didn't understand right away but they made more sense
as I practiced them hands-on. I really have enjoyed learning about some of
JavaScript's capabilities! Compared to HTML5 and CSS3, this system is totally different
and unique. I enjoy how the system can check a True/False statement, add numbers,
and loop commands.
I struggled a little bit when writing my commands initially but I am very proud of
what I came up with. Hopefully it's correct!!!
