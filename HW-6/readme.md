# I cant believe that I did this!
## I may or may not have been up all night tying it together.

When it comes to styling a website, my mind kept wanting to write HTML and CSS3 code. It was funny for me to realize how much information I have picked up in these classes and how I had to remind myself that I couldn't use HTML this week.
I felt a little frustrated at first because I couldn't get my webpage to work. I felt I had done everything right, and literally just a few minutes ago, I realized I didn't have the name linking between my JS and my HTML document named correctly. Once I fixed this, I was able to see my website and wanted to die from relief!
I am feeling really happy about my ability to tie together HTMl and Javascript. It's making me feel like I can learn any coding that I want to!


-I love how supportive this class is in the issues board. Many of the problems I have encountered, I have found solutions to in the issues board! Thanks fellow students <3
