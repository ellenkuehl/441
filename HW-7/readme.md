This week was particularly complicated for me. I felt I had a lot to learn in a short amount of time and my mind was frazzled after returning from spring break. I knew that I wanted to create a story that incorporated the player's name and best friend's name by using popup boxes, but I ran into an error when I wanted to incorporate case switch as the body of my story. Initially, I had put both the code for the pop-up boxes and the case switch on the same javascript page, but kept running into errors when trying to make the story work. Eventually, I thought outside of the box and decided to make two separate JS pages and called the functions at different points in my HTMl, which has allowed for my story to run seamlessly. Although my work isn't perfect, I did work hard to code this piece accurately and am proud of the effort that I put into this project.
