## Another week down! :D
# Let's keep rocking it!

This week, I found the inspect tool to be  very helpful for analyzing my code and analyzing my classmate's code. It was thrilling to see my "Hello World!" under the 'Console' tab in the inspect tool and to know I did this right. I learned how to put a <script> tag in my HTMl which was useful to learn as well. I'm looking forward to learning more Javascript as I've heard the possibilities are endless!
