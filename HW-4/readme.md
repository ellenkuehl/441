## Alright
### Another week down.

Another week full of amazing information! I am starting to nerd-out a little over
JavaScript. I really enjoyed the creative aspects of HTML but JS is so fascinating to learn! I am excited to learn more in my further sections.

The struggle this week was problem 5. I didn't fully understand the question and felt
stuck. I tried looking up extra resources online with no success. Hopefully next week it will be better!! :)

I tried to help a few classmates out this week, which made me feel like I was more beneficial to the class
