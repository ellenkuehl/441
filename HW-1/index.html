My name is Ellen✨ I'm a senior in the Media Arts department and will be graduating this winter after I study abroad! (Finally!) I am a lover of travel, different cultures, languages, and positivity.
In my spare time, you can find me studying Korean or Japanese, baking, gaming, and daydreaming of my next trip. I enjoy old games like Spyro The Dragon for PS1
as well as newer games like Witcher! Although I'm more of a console gamer, I've recently purchased a ton of games from Steam's winter sale, so I will be on my computer more than usual.
I'm hoping to pursue a career in video games in Japan or Korea after I graduate.</p></br>

I am not the most advanced when it comes to coding. I can remember little bits here and there, but it has been a year since I have taken a coding class! I have only taken one coding class in my life and it was Web Dev. Luckily,
I tend to be a quick learner, so I'm looking forward to learning more and trying to catch up on HTML5 and CSS3 again. Looking forward to expanding my knowledge in the realm of
coding!☝ </p>
