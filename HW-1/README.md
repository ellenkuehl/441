#First assignment complete!


I'm glad to have finished my assignment. This assignment was a little difficult at first because it's been SO long since I last touched coding. I had to re-learn GitHub and scoured w3schools for refresher information.
When I took Web Dev with Justine Evans, I was so overwhelmed with this class. Even just making an index.html was too much for me! It's a great feeling to look forward to learning more code. I used to hate the idea of coding and didn't enjoy it at first, but with a constantly developing technological society, it's an important tool for Media Artists to have! The coding part isn't my favorite- I look forward to seeing the art I can create through code.

This week I moved from Bozeman back to Missoula. That being said, I didn't have much time to post on the issues board or ask anyone for help. Hopefully this next week, I will be more useful.
