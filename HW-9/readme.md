I have had challenges this semester with this class but I have enjoyed most of the material we have covered. Being an avid
gamer, I LOVED the last assignment where we got to create our own adventure story and felt I overcame my issues by thinking outside
the box.
 That being said, this material was not something I could quite understand.
I have had yet to encounter an assignment where I felt I couldn't do it, but alas, this was the one.
I figured it was better to turn in something rather than nothing at all, but I am embarrassed to admit
that I was unable to pull this off.
